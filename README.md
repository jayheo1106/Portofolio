- Udacity Data Analyst Projects https://github.com/Mr-Chang95/Portfolio
This folder consists of multiple sub-folders of projects that I’ve completed with Udacity’s Data Analyst program. There are a total of 4 folders where the primary focus is to practice the Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) process which includes gathering and wrangling data then analyzing and visualizing them. Here is a list of the projects and a short explanation to complement them:

Movie Database Analysis: In this project, the skills that I’ve demonstrated are: assessing and cleaning data, analyzing data and visualizing data. The goal of this project is to answer the questions that I asked at the beginning.
Analyze Web Page A/B Test: For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. In this project, I’ve demonstrated my skills in Probability, A/B Testing and Logistic Regression.
Twitter Data Wrangling & Analysis: In this project, I gathered data from the archives of a Twitter account called WeRateDogs which rates owned dogs in their tweets and adds a humorous comment with it. My primary goal for this project is to practice the data analysis process which includes gathering data using the Twitter API, downloading datasets programmatically with the requests and BeautifulSoup library, cleaning and analyzing the data, and visualizing them.
Loans Exploratory Data Analysis: In this project, I am interested in conducting the full exploratory data analysis process on a dataset that was provided to me by Prosper Loan via Udacity. Along with assessing and cleaning the dataset, I demonstrated my skills in creating different kinds of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations to study the different variables and their relationships with one another. Afterward, I used my analysis and visuals that I’ve created to create a slideshow presentation as if I were presenting it to stakeholders.
SQL Movie Rental Analysis: In this project, I will be querying the Sakila DVD Rental database, which holds information about a company that rents DVDs. I am doing this to gain an understanding of the customer base and to answer the questions asked at the beginning of the project. While the goal of this project is to investigate the database and create visuals answering the questions listed above, this project is also an opportunity to showcase what I've learned as part of the Nanodegree program. Some skills I would like to draw attention to are my ability to join many tables, create window functions, create Common Table Expressions (CTE) and perform calculations with the help of logical operators.
